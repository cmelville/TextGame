# TextGame
A proof of concept adventure game inspired by Table Top RPGâ€™s. Built from the ground up using JavaFX paired with Scene Builder to create a functional user interface. Utilizes XML behind the scenes to create and display text and graphics. Independent project to explore further the concepts and skills taught in my Computer Science II course.
